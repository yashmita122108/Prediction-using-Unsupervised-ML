# Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML
Predicting the optimum number of clusters in the 'Iris' dataset using unsupervised machine learning is a valuable task in data analysis and pattern recognition. It allows us to uncover the inherent structure of the data and gain insights into the relationships between iris flower samples. By selecting the most appropriate clustering algorithm and visualizing the results, we can provide valuable information for further analysis and decision-making in various fields, including botany and biology. This task showcases the power of unsupervised machine learning in extracting meaningful patterns from data without the need for labeled outcomes.
